    <h1>My Name</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class = "container-light1"> 
    <p>I live in the North West of the United Kingdom and am currently studying Python with the aim of becoming a software developer. 
       I have a keen interest in technology and am excited about the opportunities it presents. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading comics—especially from the 80s and 90s era—both from Marvel and DC. 
       Recently, I’ve been purchasing a lot of novels, a medium I was never really a fan of before. Over the last year, 
       I’ve been buying science fiction and fantasy books, and The Lord of the Rings is the first series I’ll be diving into. In my spare time, I like drawing and am currently working on a project 
       where I’m designing my own versions of DC’s famous heroes. Although currently unemployed, I’m eager to break into the field of software development and contribute to the tech industry in some capacity.

        <h2>Three Places I'd Like to Visit</h2>
        <div class="container-dark2">
        <h3> Zakopane, Poland</h3>
        <img src = "https://www.ontheluce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/zakopane-in-winter.jpg" alt = "A photo Zakopane during the winter." width = "640" height = "400">
        <p> A place I'd would like to visit is Zakopane especially during the later months of the year. Staying in a wooden cabin surrounded by a thick blanket of snow, something a kin to a Christmas Card.</p> 
        <h3> Akihabara, Tokyo, Japan</h3>
        <img src = "https://thecreativeadventurer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/40985294385_57ff722c01_k-1280x720.jpg" alt = "A photo a street located Akihabara, Tokyo  within Japan." width = "640" height = "360" >
        <p> Another place I would like to visit is Akihabra, located within Tokyo, Japan. The reason why I want to visit this place is so I can visit the main hub of anime culture.Though to be fair, it will probably be part of a larger trip. Where I would travel to most famous locations in Japan, with this location being keypoint of that trip. </p>
        <h3> Copenhagen, Denmark</h3>
        <img src = "https://www.acouplescalling.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/nyhavn-canal-viewpoint-copenhagen.jpg" alt = "A row of Town Houses along side the Nyhavn River in Copenhagen, Denmark." width = "640" height = "360">
        <p> The last place I would like to visit is Copenhagen in Denmark, not only because of the views, both natural and architectural, but it would also give me the chance to meet a long time friend in person.</p>
