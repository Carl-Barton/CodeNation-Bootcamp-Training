# I'm writing the objective for this project here in this file, since I'm still getting the hang of HTML 
# and I don't want to mess something up in the files now that they work
# 

# Objective: Create a one page website about yourself.
# Include:
# Your Name
# A paragraph about yourself
# A section detailing your skills
# Three images of a place you'd like to visit and why

# List at least 3 of your favourites based some of these subjects:
# Past Times
# Songs
# Movies
# Places to visit
# Historical figures
# Sports teams

# That being said our instructor had no problem us changing the subjects, so I choose these:
# Video Games 
# Movies 
# Places to visit


# Side Note, on Day 16 we were given the activity/ task to add more styling to our webpage.
# The activity was this:

# Objective: Begin styling your website from the last session!
#            Your styling choices are up to you, as long as your first favourite item in a category is gold,
#            your second favourite is in silver, and your third favourite is in bronze.
