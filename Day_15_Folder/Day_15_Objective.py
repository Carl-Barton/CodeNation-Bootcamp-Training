# I'm writing the objective for this project here in this file, since I'm still getting the hang of HTML 
# and I don't want to mess something up in the files now that they work
# 

# Objective: Create a one page website about yourself.
# Include:
# Your Name
# A paragraph about yourself
# A section detailing your skills
# Three images of a place you'd like to visit and why

# List at least 3 of your favourites based some of these subjects:
# Past Times
# Songs
# Movies
# Places to visit
# Historical figures
# Sports teams

# That being said our instructor had no problem us changing the subjects, so I choose these:
# Video Games 
# Movies 
# Places to visit
